 1. Data wrangling:
Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it ready for analysis. It typically involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: This involves collecting the data from various sources.
2. Data Cleaning: This involves cleaning the data to ensure that it is ready for analysis by:
   - Handling missing values
   - Handling outliers
   - Handling inconsistent or incorrect values
   - Converting data types
   - Handling duplicates
3. Data Integration: This involves merging multiple datasets into one, if necessary.
4. Data Transformation: This involves transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis by:
   - Normalizing or scaling the data
   - Creating new variables or features
   - Reshaping the data
5. Data Reduction: This involves reducing the size of the data by:
   - Sampling the data
   - Filtering out irrelevant data
   - Reducing the dimensionality of the data by using techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or feature selection.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory data analysis is the process of exploring and visualizing the data to understand its structure and identify patterns. It typically involves the following steps:

- Data visualization: This involves creating graphs, charts, and other visual representations of the data to identify trends, relationships, and patterns.

- Data summary: This involves calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to describe the distribution of the data.

- Data distribution: This involves examining the distribution of the data, such as its skewness and kurtosis, to identify any issues that may affect the accuracy of the analysis.

- Data relationships: This involves examining the relationship between different variables and identifying any correlations or causations.

3. Feature engineering is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline that involves transforming and creating new features from existing data to improve model performance. Here's a step-by-step guide for feature engineering:

   1. Data Exploration and Understanding:
      - Analyze and understand the dataset, including the feature types, distributions, and relationships between variables.
      - Identify potential issues such as missing values, outliers, or skewness in the data.

   2. Handling Missing Values:
      - Identify columns with missing values and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle them.
      - Options include removing rows with missing values, filling missing values with mean/median/mode, or using advanced techniques like regression imputation.

   3. Handling Outliers:
      - Detect outliers in the dataset that may negatively impact the model's performance.
      - Decide on a strategy to handle outliers, such as removing them, replacing them with a threshold value, or transforming them using techniques like winsorization.

   4. Encoding Categorical Variables:
      - Convert categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
      - Options include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.

   5. Feature Scaling:
      - Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
      - Common techniques include min-max scaling (normalization) or z-score standardization.

   6. Handling Skewed Data:
      - Identify features with significant skewness, as skewed distributions can negatively affect model performance.
      - Apply transformations like logarithmic, square root, or box-cox to reduce skewness and make the data more symmetrical.

   7. Feature Creation:
      - Generate new features that might capture additional information or patterns in the data.
      - Examples include interaction features (combinations of existing features), polynomial features, or domain-specific feature engineering.

   8. Feature Selection:
      - Select the most relevant features that contribute the most to the target variable and remove redundant or irrelevant features.
      - Use techniques like univariate selection, recursive feature elimination, or feature importance from tree-based models.

   9. Dimensionality Reduction:
      - If dealing with high-dimensional data, consider reducing the number of features to improve model efficiency and avoid overfitting.
      - Techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or t-SNE can be applied to project the data onto a lower-dimensional space.

   10. Iterative Evaluation and Improvement:
      - Iterate through the feature engineering process, reevaluate the model's performance, and make adjustments as needed.
      - Test different combinations of feature engineering techniques and evaluate their impact on model performance using appropriate validation techniques.

   Remember, feature engineering is an iterative process, and the specific steps may vary depending on the dataset, domain knowledge, and the machine learning problem at hand. It's essential to experiment, iterate, and evaluate the impact of each step on the final model's performance.
