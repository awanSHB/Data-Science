Different types of visualization graphs and charts are used for different purposes and are suited for different types of data. Here are some common types of graphs and charts and their uses:

1. **Bar chart:** Bar charts are useful for comparing different categories of data. They can be used to compare numerical data (such as sales figures) or categorical data (such as types of products sold). 

2. **Line chart:** Line charts are useful for showing trends over time. They can be used to track changes in a variable over a period of time, such as changes in stock prices or sales figures. 

3. **Pie chart:** Pie charts are useful for showing how a whole is divided into different parts. They can be used to show the proportion of each category within a dataset, such as the percentage of different types of products sold in a store. 

4. **Histogram:** Histograms are useful for showing the distribution of numerical data. They can be used to show the frequency of data within specific ranges or bins. 

5. **Scatter plot:** Scatter plots are useful for showing the relationship between two variables. They can be used to identify patterns or trends in data and to see if there is a correlation between two variables. 

6. **Heat map:** Heat maps are useful for showing the concentration of data points in a two-dimensional space. They can be used to identify areas of high or low density in a dataset, such as the concentration of customers in different geographic areas. 

7. **Bubble chart:** Bubble charts are useful for showing the relationship between three variables. They can be used to compare data across three dimensions, such as the size of different cities based on population, GDP, and area. 

8. **Box plot:** Box plots are useful for showing the distribution of data and identifying outliers. They can be used to show the median, quartiles, and range of a dataset, and to identify any data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. 

Overall, the choice of visualization graph or chart will depend on the type of data and the message you want to convey. It is important to choose the most appropriate type of visualization to ensure that your audience can easily understand the data and insights presented.
